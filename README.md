# Predict_next_word
A ML project that can predict the next word while user is typing based on a dataset
  Next Word Prediction Using Markov Chain Model ðŸ§®
The "Next Word Prediction Using Markov Model" project is an academic initiative centered around the Markov chain model concept. Developed entirely in Python and utilizing the msvcrt module, this project aims to create a practical next word prediction system. The main objective is to leverage the predictive capabilities of Markov models to anticipate the most likely word to come after a given sequence of words. The implementation in Python, with the support of the msvcrt module, ensures a smooth and efficient execution, making it a valuable exploration of language modeling and prediction within the framework of Markov chains.
